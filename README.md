## *FIFA19* Player Ranking Prediction and Analysis

![Fifa19 Cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91yLVC5QshL._SX342_.jpg) 

The objective is to build models that predict a player's overall rank in *Fifa19*, and find the most relevant predictors of it.  This is in pursuit of balancing predictability and explainability of machine learning models.

### Getting Started

The analysis is performed in R Studio.  Relevant libraries used include:

* ```tidyverse```
* ```stringr```
* ```randomForest```
* ```magrittr```
* ```purrr```
* ```ggpubr```
* ```corrplot```
* ```car```

### Where is the report?

Because Github does not support formatting styles available with R Markdown, the analysis document is hosted on my [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/) account [here](http://rpubs.com/triceraptops/524786).  The code and dataset reside in this repository.
